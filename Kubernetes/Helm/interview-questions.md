# Helm Interview Questions

---

**1. Do you use Helm? Which version do you use currently and do you see benefits
of using Helm?**

- **Answer:** Yes, Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps in
  managing and deploying applications. The version of Helm I currently use is
  [insert version number]. There are several benefits of using Helm:

  - Simplified deployment: Helm provides a simple and standardized way to
    package, version, and deploy applications on Kubernetes.

  - Templating: Helm allows templating of Kubernetes manifests, making it easier
    to manage configurations across different environments.

  - Versioning: Helm charts support versioning, enabling teams to track changes
    to their application deployments over time.

  - Community support: Helm has a large and active community, with a wide range
    of charts available for common applications and services, reducing the
    effort required to deploy complex applications.

  Overall, using Helm streamlines the deployment process, improves consistency,
  and enhances collaboration among team members working with Kubernetes-based
  applications.

**2. Why use Helm in Kubernetes?**

- **Answer:** Helm offers several advantages for managing applications in
  Kubernetes:

  - **Package Management:** Helm provides a convenient way to package Kubernetes
    applications and their dependencies into reusable units called charts. This
    simplifies the process of distributing, installing, and upgrading
    applications.

  - **Templating:** Helm allows users to use templates to generate Kubernetes
    manifests dynamically. This makes it easier to manage configurations across
    different environments and reduces duplication of code.

  - **Versioning:** Helm supports versioning for charts, enabling teams to track
    changes to their application deployments over time and rollback to previous
    versions if necessary.

  - **Community Support:** Helm has a vibrant community with a large collection
    of publicly available charts for common applications and services. This
    community support accelerates the development and deployment of Kubernetes
    applications by providing pre-configured solutions for various use cases.

  - **Customization:** Helm charts can be customized to meet specific
    requirements, allowing users to tailor deployments to their needs while
    still benefiting from the structure and best practices provided by Helm.

  Overall, using Helm in Kubernetes simplifies application deployment, improves
  consistency, facilitates collaboration, and accelerates the development
  lifecycle.

**3. Which Helm repository do you use today to store/access Helm charts?**

**Answer:** I currently use Azure Container Registries to store and access Helm
charts. Here's why:

- **Integration:** Azure Container Registries integrate well with other Azure
  cloud services, especially when working with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- **Security:** It offers robust access control and security features important
  for production environments.
- **Scalability:** It's designed to handle large volumes of charts as needed.

**Other popular options:**

Public repositories:

- Helm Hub: The central repository for open-source Helm charts.
  [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh)

Hosted container registries (with OCI support):

- Amazon ECR
- Docker Hub
- Google Artifact Registry
- Harbor
- IBM Cloud Container Registry
- JFrog Artifactory

**Factors when choosing a Helm Repository:**

- **Security:** Consider the sensitivity of your charts and required security
  levels.
- **Accessibility:** Public vs. private repositories, or self-hosting for
  maximum control.
- **Integration:** Compatibility with your existing development and deployment
  workflows.
