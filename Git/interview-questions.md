### 2. What is branch protection in github ?

**Answer:** Branch protection in GitHub is a feature that allows repository
administrators to configure certain rules and restrictions for specific

requiring status checks to pass, restricting who can push to the branch, and
enforcing certain branch merge strategies. Branch protection helps maintain code
quality, prevent accidental changes, and enforce collaboration best practices.
