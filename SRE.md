## Goal

Understand what SRE is and how following its practices will help you architect efficient systems and services in the cloud.

## What is Site Reliability Engineering?

- **Blend of software and systems engineering:** SRE combines aspects of both fields to create robust, scalable, and efficient systems.
- **Highly automated, self-healing systems:** The goal is to minimize manual intervention and enable systems to recover from failures automatically.
- **Efficient management of high traffic and demand:** SRE ensures systems can handle spikes in usage without degradation.

## Key Principles

- **Automation:** Heavy reliance on automation for provisioning, deployments, and scaling.
- **Observability:** Emphasis on detailed monitoring and comprehensive observability.
- **Incident Response:** Formal processes for rapid issue resolution.
- **Capacity Planning:** Proactively anticipating future demand and preparing systems accordingly.
- **Resilience:** Designing systems to withstand and recover from failures.

## Outcomes of SRE Principles

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Optimizing infrastructure and costs.
- **Maximum System Availability and Reliability:** Ensuring minimal downtime and consistent performance.
- **Seamless Scalability:** Ability to scale up or down efficiently based on demand.
- **Rapid Issue Resolution:** Faster fixes for outages and performance degradations.
